Specifying Materials
  In order to run problems, you must create materials. Materials must be either Fuel or Oxidizer (F or O) objects
  Constructor Parameters:
  __init__(name, temp=298, wt_percent=None, mols=None, chemical_composition = None, hf = None):
    name: required parameter, the CEA material name with correct spelling. E.G. aluminum is "Al(cr)" and methane is "CH4"
      If you specify chemical_composition, can be whatever you want
    temp: specified reactant temperature, kelvin
    wt_percent: A weight-based percentage for the element. Weight percentages do not need to add up to 100, and are calculated on the ratio with other Fuels/Oxidizers
    mols: A mol-based percentage for the element. Can be used as in Oxidizer("O2", mols=1) and Oxidizer("N2", mols=3.76) for air (except CEA has "air" as a reactant...)
      wt_percent and mols cannot be specified together, if neither is defined, the Material gets a wt_percent of 1
    chemical_composition: chemical composition such as "LI 1 B 1 H 4" for LiBH4. If defined, will not use CEA default values ### UNTESTED
    hf:  Enthalpy of formation, kJ/kg, must be specified if chemical_composition is specified ### UNTESTED

Generic Problem Methods:
  Constructor Parameters (making new Problem Objects):
  __init__(**kwargs):
    ### NOTE: all parameters must be specified by keyword, e.g. problem = RocketProblem(pressure=500, massf=True)
    pressure: default 1000, Initial problem pressure
      pressure can be specified later with .set_pressure 
    materials: default None, List of Material objects, order doesn't matter, of Oxidizer and Fuel objects e.g. materials=[material1, material2, ...]
      materials can be specified later with .set_materials([material1, material2, ...])
      materials can also be specified when you run a problem like problem.run_cea(material1, material2, ...)
      materials MUST all have wt_percent specified or all have mols specified, can't have mixtures.
    massf: default False, CEA usually outputs product ratios in mole ratios, if massf is True, mass ratios are specified
      massf can be specified later with .set_massf
    filename: default "my_output", the filename we save our .inp files to and CEA saves our .out and .plt to.
      DO NOT INCLUDE ".inp" IN YOUR FILENAMES. Do not include any slashes.
      filename can be specified later with .set_filename
    pressure_units: default "psi", the units that your input pressure is in. Possible values are "bar", "atm", "psi", or "mmh"
      pressure_units can be specified later with .set_pressure_units
    inserts: default None, a list of CEA names for species which should be forced into the product considerations
      Tip: If you are doing calculations with Aluminum, I recommend using inserts=["AL2O3(L)", "AL2O3(a)"]
    omits: default None, a list of CEA names for species which should be specifically ignored in the product considerations
    ### NOTE: You must specify one of the following reactant ratio schemes. Either during initialization with x=1.0 or later with problem.set_x(1.0) where x is p_f, o_f, etc.
    Specifying reactant ratios:
      | Key  | CEA Key | Description
      +------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      | p_f  |  %f     | Percent fuel by weight
      | f_o  |  f/o    | Fuel-to-oxidant weight ratio
      | o_f  |  o/f    | Oxidant-to-fuel weight ratio
      | phi  |  phi    | Equivalence ratios in terms of fuel-to-oxidant weight ratios (eq. (9.19) in Gordon and McBride, 1994)
      | r_eq |  r      | Chemical equivalence ratios in terms of valences (eq. (9.18) in Gordon and McBride, 1994)
   
   data = run_cea(*materials)
    Run the CEA problem, returning an "Output" dictionary (keys and values specified later in this documentation)
    Inputs are an optional material list. If materials are not specified as an initial parameter or with .set_materials, you can list them here.
  
  set_absolute_o_f()
    Have you ever specified all your components in absolute percentages, and then have to manually calculate the o_f ratio based on what is fuel and what is oxidizer?
    Well no more! Just call this function and we calculate the correct o_f ratio for you so that your absolute percentages are correctly reflected in the problem.
      Functions off of the existing material list, so call this after setting materials

Rocket Problem Constructor Parameters:
  ae_at: default 1, exit/throat area ratio
    ae_at can be specified later with .set_ae_at
  analysis_type: default "equilibrium", whether to use equilibrium reactions or frozen. If you want to use frozen go find the correct value for this in the CEA manual. I don't guarantee output values work correctly.

Available Output Dictionary Keys:
  All output objects are "Output" objects, which are similar to dictionaries, but can also be accessed with dot notation.
  For example if you had "data = problem.run_cea()", and wanted pressure, you could do either data.p or data["p"]
  In addition, all product dictionaries are also "Output"s so to get H2O composition, you could use data.prod_c.H2O or data["prod_c"]["H2O"] or data["prod_c"].H2O, etc.
